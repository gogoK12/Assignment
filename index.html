        <h3>I love my dog</h3>
        <p> If you have a dog, chances are, you would do almost anything for them. Those “feels”- they are very real.

            While the nuances of dog ownership aren’t all glorious — between the poop bags, fur all over your clothes, and planning your entire life around their bathroom habits — there’s still a powerful and extremely tangible bond that exists between human and dog.
            
            As the owner of a border-collie mix who first crawled into my heart and home almost 15 years ago, I was reminded of this special bond when we got the news that we had to put him down.
            
            This is Willie. He was the rascal puppy who would lick the dishes before they went in the dishwasher. He was the best cross-country skiing and running partner you could ask for. And if he ever saw a squirrel… watch out!
        </p>
